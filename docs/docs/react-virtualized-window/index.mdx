## What is Virtualized Window

A virtualized window is a React component for creating views on data where only the data items visible to the user are rendered.

For example, imagine you had an autocomplete dropdown that could potentially have 1000s of choices. Rendering 1000s of `div`
elements in the browser can become a performance bottleneck. Furthermore it's uncessary, since at any given time only a handful of the
items will be visible to the user.

`@resembli/react-virtualized-window` provides components that solve this problem by rendering only what is visible to the user into the dom.
This keeps your website responsive and performant.

### What does `@resembli/react-virtualized-window` support?

The following features are supported:

- Row virtualization
- Column virtualization
- RTL direction fully supported
- React 18 concurrent mode ready
- TypeScript typings
- Variable width and height data items
- Automatic window sizing out the box, with resize handling
- and much more...

## Brief overview of the react-virtualized-window components

| Component                                                        | Description                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [List](/docs/react-virtualized-window/list)                      | Useful for rendering a list of items. The List component vertically virtualizes the view                        |
| [ListHorizontal](/docs/react-virtualized-window/list-horizontal) | Useful for rendering a horizontal list of items. The ListHorizontal component horizontally virtualizes the view |
| [Grid](/docs/react-virtualized-window/grid)                      | Useful for rendering tabular data. The Grid component horizontally and vertically virtualizes the view          |

## Basic Walkthrough

### Step 1: Creating a Sized Container

The virtualized components all work the same way, and share the same base implementation. The first thing you need to do is created a sized container.
A **sized** container must have a width and height even when it is empty. It should also not grow as the contents rendered inside it grow. The simplested
and most straight forward way is to create a `div` with some height and width, e.g:

```jsx
import { Grid } from "@resembli/react-virtualized-window"

function MyGrid() {
  return <div style={{ height: 400, width: 400 }}>{/* To be filled in soon */}</div>
}
```

:::info
We are using the `<Grid/>` component here which virtualizes horizontally and vertically and hence requires both width and height to be sized.
In the case of the `<List/>` and `<ListHorizontal/>` only the height or width is required to be sized respectively.
:::

:::tip
You can use percentage sizing as well but you need to ensure the parent itself resolves to a size. For example, the following is a valid
sized container setup for the window components:

```jsx
<div style={{ display: "grid", gridTemplateColumns: "400px, 800px", gridTemplateRows: 400 }}>
  <div style={{ width: "50%", height: "50%" }}>
    <Grid />
  </div>
</div>
```

In the above sizing container, the `<Grid/>` window is rendered in the first column of the first row. The first column is `400px` wide and `400px`
tall. Our sizing container specifies the `<Grid/>` should take up `50%` of the width and height, hence the `<Grid/>` component will be `200px` wide
and tall.
:::

### Step 2: Creating a Render Component

Next we need to create a React component that we can use to render our individual items. The window components will use the component to render
the items. For each data item the window component will pass the data for the that item, styles we need to apply to the item, and some meta data
about the item's position in the grid. The metadata is not necessary for rendering items. We now have

```jsx
import { Grid } from "@resembli/react-virtualized-window"

function RenderItem(props) {
  const [row, column] = props.data // The piece of data for this item.
  const style = props.style // The CSSProperties we need to pass to our item

  return (
    <div style={style}>
      {row},{column}
    </div>
  )
}

function MyGrid() {
  return <div style={{ height: 400, width: 400 }}>{/* To be filled in soon */}</div>
}
```

Notice this just a regular React component. It's important that we apply the style passed as a prop to our component.

:::caution

The `style` prop passed to our `RenderItem` component contains styles relevant to the sizing of the component. In particular
it sets the `width` and `height` values, and the `margin` values.

It's important these dimensions remain unchanged and items need to have known widths and heights for the virtualization to work
correctly.

A common mistake is to apply a border to our `RenderItem`, e.g.

```jsx
<div style={{ border: "1px solid black", ...style }}>...</div>
```

However this changes the dimension of the `div` the `box-sizing` style is `content-box`, which is the default. The correct way to
give a virtualized item a border to set the `box-sizing` style as well:

```jsx
<div style={{ border: "1px solid black", boxSizing: "border-box", ...style }}>...</div>
```

:::

### Step 3: Render the Window Component with our Data

We can now render the componet by passing our data to the grid. It's important we pass our `RenderItem` as a value, and not as a `JSX` object.
We are rendering the `<Grid>` component here so the data we pass should be a matrix.

```jsx
import { Grid } from "@resembli/react-virtualized-window"

// Create a 1000x100 matrix
const dummyData = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, row) =>
  Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, column) => [row, column]),
)

function RenderItem(props) {
  const [row, column] = props.data // The piece of data for this item.
  const style = props.style // The CSSProperties we need to pass to our item

  return (
    <div style={style}>
      {row},{column}
    </div>
  )
}
function MyGrid() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: 400, width: 400 }}>
      <Grid defaultRowHeight={50} defaultColumnWidth={100} data={dummyData}>
        {RenderItem}
      </Grid>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The end result:

import { MyGrid } from "./_components/WalkthoughGrid.js"

<MyGrid />
