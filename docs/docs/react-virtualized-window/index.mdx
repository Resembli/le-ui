title: React Virtualized Window
---

## What is a virtualized window?

A virtualized window is a React component for creating views on data where only the data items visible to the user are rendered.

For example, imagine you had an autocomplete dropdown that could potentially have 1000s of choices. Rendering 1000s of `div`
elements in the browser can become a performance bottleneck. Furthermore it's uncessary, since at any given time only a handful of the
items will be visible to the user.

`@resembli/react-virtualized-window` provides components that solve this problem by rendering only what is visible to the user into the DOM.
This keeps your website responsive and performant. The `Grid` below has 100,000 cells, but only the cells visible to the user
are actually present in the DOM.

import { ShowcaseGrid } from "./_components/ShowcaseGrid.tsx"

<ShowcaseGrid />

```tsx title="Basic Grid Example"
import type { RenderItem } from "@resembli/react-virtualized-window"
import { Grid } from "@resembli/react-virtualized-window"

const data = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, row) => {
  return Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, column) => {
    return [row, column]
  })
})

const CellItem: RenderItem<number[]> = ({ data, style, cellMeta: { row, column } }) => {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        background: (row + column) % 2 === 1 ? "#f8f8f0" : "white",
        color: "black",
        ...style,
      }}
    >
      {data[0]},{data[1]}
    </div>
  )
}

export function ShowcaseGrid() {
  return (
    <Grid
      height={400}
      defaultRowHeight={60}
      defaultColumnWidth={60}
      data={data}
      style={{ border: "1px solid grey" }}
    >
      {CellItem}
    </Grid>
  )
}
```

## Brief overview of the react-virtualized-window components

| Component                                   | Description                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [List](/docs/react-virtualized-window/list) | Useful for rendering a list of items. The List component vertically or horizontally virtualizes the view |
| [Grid](/docs/react-virtualized-window/grid) | Useful for rendering tabular data. The Grid component horizontally and vertically virtualizes the view   |

## Basic walkthrough

### Step 1: Creating a sized container

The virtualized components all work the same way, and share the same base implementation. The first thing you need to do is create a sized container.
A **sized** container must have a width and height even when it is empty. It should also not grow as the contents rendered inside it grows. The simplested
and most straight forward way is to create a `div` with some height and width, e.g:

```jsx
import { Grid } from "@resembli/react-virtualized-window"

function MyGrid() {
  return <div style={{ height: 400, width: 400 }}>{/* To be filled in soon */}</div>
}
```

:::info
We are using the `<Grid/>` component here which virtualizes horizontally and vertically and hence requires both width and height to be sized.
In the case of the `<List/>` only the height or width is required to be sized dependent on the `Layout` property (which can either be `vertical` or `horizontal`).
:::

:::tip
You can use percentage sizing as well but you need to ensure the parent itself resolves to a size. For example, the following is a valid
sized container setup for the window components:

```jsx
<div style={{ display: "grid", gridTemplateColumns: "400px, 800px", gridTemplateRows: 400 }}>
  <Grid width="50%" height="50%" />
</div>
```

In the above sizing container, the `<Grid/>` window is rendered in the first column of the first row. The first column is `400px` wide and `400px`
tall. We specify the `<Grid/>` should take up `50%` of the width and height, hence the `<Grid/>` component will be `200px` wide
and tall.
:::

### Step 2: Creating a render component

Next we need to create a React component that we can use to render our individual items. The window components will use the component to render
the items. For each data item, the window component will pass the data for the that item, the styles we need to apply to the item, and some meta data
about the item's position in the grid as `props` to the component. The metadata is not necessary for rendering items. We now have the following:

```jsx
import { Grid } from "@resembli/react-virtualized-window"

function RenderItem(props) {
  const [row, column] = props.data // The piece of data for this item.
  const style = props.style // The CSSProperties we need to pass to our item

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        border: "1px solid gray",
        boxSizing: "border-box",
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        ...style,
      }}
    >
      {row},{column}
    </div>
  )
}

function MyGrid() {
  return <div style={{ height: 400, width: 400 }}>{/* To be filled in soon */}</div>
}
```

Notice this just a regular React component. It's important that we apply the style passed as a prop to our component.

:::caution

The `style` prop passed to our `RenderItem` component contains styles relevant to the sizing of the component. In particular
it sets the `width`, `height`, and `margin` CSS values.

It's important these dimensions remain unchanged and items need to have known widths and heights for the virtualization to work
correctly.

A common mistake is to apply a border to a `RenderItem`, e.g.

```jsx
<div style={{ border: "1px solid black", ...style }}>...</div>
```

However this changes the dimension of the `div` if the `box-sizing` style is `content-box`, which is the default in browsers. The correct way to
give a virtualized item a border to set the `box-sizing` style to `border-box`, in addition to setting the border value:

```jsx
<div style={{ border: "1px solid black", boxSizing: "border-box", ...style }}>...</div>
```

:::

### Step 3: Render the window component with our data

We can now render the componet by passing our data to the grid. It's important we pass our `RenderItem` as a value, and not as a `JSX` object.
We are rendering the `<Grid>` component here so the data we pass should be a matrix (i.e. an array of arrays).

```jsx
import { Grid } from "@resembli/react-virtualized-window"

// Create a 1000x100 matrix
const dummyData = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, row) =>
  Array.from({ length: 100 }, (_, column) => [row, column]),
)

function RenderItem(props) {
  const [row, column] = props.data // The piece of data for this item.
  const style = props.style // The CSSProperties we need to pass to our item

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        border: "1px solid gray",
        boxSizing: "border-box",
        display: "flex",
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
        ...style,
      }}
    >
      {row},{column}
    </div>
  )
}

function MyGrid() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: 400, width: 400 }}>
      <Grid defaultRowHeight={50} defaultColumnWidth={100} data={dummyData}>
        {RenderItem}
      </Grid>
    </div>
  )
}
```

:::tip

It is possible (and okay) to define your `RenderItem` inline, and in fact you many of our examples do this. For example:

```jsx
function MyGrid() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: 400, width: 400 }}>
      <Grid defaultRowHeight={50} defaultColumnWidth={100} data={dummyData}>
        {(props) => {
          // Our render item component as before
        }}
      </Grid>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Note** you should not use any React hooks when defining the component inline, and in fact this is one disadvantage of using
an inline function instead of a separate `RenderItem`.

The end result:

import { MyGrid } from "./_components/WalkthoughGrid.js"

<MyGrid />

## Basic concepts

### The `NumberOrPercent` type

The different window components accept `columnWidths` and `rowHeights` properties, as well as their corresponding defaults (`defaultColumnWidth` and `defaultRowHeight`).
The value provided to these components can either be number or a percent string. For example:

```jsx
// the default row height is assumed to be 40
<List defaultRowHeight={40}>...</List>

// or the default row height is assumed to be 10% of the window height
<List defaultRowHeight="10%">...</List>
```

The `number` value is straight forward, `40 === 40px`. However, percent values are not the same as the `CSS` percent value representation.
Row height percent values are based on the `window` height. Colum width percent values are based on the the `window` width.

:::caution

If the component has a `gap` value set, this will not be included as part of the percentage calcuation, so the items width or height will be the
`percentage px value + gap px value`.

:::

### The `sticky` div

On most browsers scrolling happens on a separate thread. Virtualization calculations happen on the main thread. This means it's possible for the user
to scroll before the window has determined what are next items to render and what position they should be in. This leads to content flashing in. This issue
is present in all virtualization libaries and inherent to the way browsers work. This is [execellent article for those looking to understand more](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/03/08/scrolling-on-the-web/).

Despite the explanation given above, you may notice that when you scroll quickly the contents within the `@resembli/react-virtualized-window` components
do not flash in and out and the checkboarding pattern is not present.

This is due to a `sticky` positioning div that keeps the window in place and in view even as the user scrolls. For example, if we compare
the rendering of the `FixedSizedGrid` from [react-window](https://react-window.vercel.app/#/examples/list/fixed-size) to a fixed sized grid example
from `@resembli/react-virtualized-window`, we can see checkboarding vs no checkboarding in effect:

:::info

This is **NOT** a performance comparison, or even a comparison of `react-window` to `@resembli/react-virtualized-window`. This is a demonstration of
the checkboarding effect present in other `virtualization` frameworks, which is not present in `@resembli/react-virtualized-window` (unless you disable the stick `div`
using the `disableSticky` prop).

The grids below have the following characteristics:

- Heigth and Width of `800px`
- Column width of `100px`
- Row height of `30px`

### Tab-index

It's possible to give individual items rendered into the window components a tab index - but this is not recommended. If you do give individual items a tab index
be sure to set the `overscan` property to something greater than 1. This is necessary to allow the browser to tab to items that are out of view.

:::caution

The window components are intended to render large number of items (10,000+ in many cases). If the individual items have tab indices set, its possible the user
can get stuck tabbing through all the items. For this reason we do not recommend adding a tab index to the individual items.

You should add a value to the `tabIndex` property available on the window componets. This will allow the user to tab to the list and control it with the other
keyboard keys (up, down, page-up, page-down, etc).

### Searching for text

Browsers provide the ability for users to search for a string of text by pressing `Ctrl-F` (or `Cmd-F` on a Mac). This functionality relies on text content being
rendered to the dom. Virtualization is the process of rendering only what is visible to the dom. Hence, items that are out of view will not be searchable by the
browser. The common workaround for this issue is to build your own search logic - which is able to the scoll to the desired item. You can do this with the imperative
`VirtualizedWindowApi`.
