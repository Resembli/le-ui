## What is le-window

The window is a React component for creating virtualized views. A virtualized view is an element that renders only what is visible to the user
in browser. It is a necessary performance optimization when we want to render a large number of items in the browser.

### Example

The is list below contains 10,000 items. Only what is visible is rendered and attached to the browser's DOM, but the user can scroll through all
10,000 items.

import { WindowExample } from "../../src/components/WindowExample.tsx"

<WindowExample />
