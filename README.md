`@resembli/react-virtualized-window` provides basic components for creating virtualized views. Virtualization is a rendering method
where only the dom element visible to the user are rendered. Using the components in this package it's possible to render lists or
grids with 100,000s of items without any noticeable impact on rendering performance.
